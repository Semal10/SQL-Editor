## Page Load Time

DOMContentLoad : 1.31s
Page Load : 257ms

## Calculation of Page Load Time

I tested this using various processes.

1) Using Network tab in Chrome Dev Tool

So what i did is i checked the DOMContentLoad & Page Load Speed in Network by clicking Ctrl + R which automatic measures it for us. But there may be thin error in this process, so i tested it 5 more continuous times i stored the average time.

2) Using React Dev Tools in Lighthouse

There is a button in Lighthouse Tab which generates us the whole report regarding performance, SEO , accessibility, and reliabilty. I scored 92+ in all of the above and also stored the page load speed in performance review.

Lasting i took the average of all the above methods , and stated it to be my final DOMContentLoad & Page Load time.
